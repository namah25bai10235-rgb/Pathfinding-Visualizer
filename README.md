# Pathfinding-Visualizer

AI Pathfinding Visualizer

Overview :

This project is an interactive Pathfinding Visualizer that demonstrates how fundamental Artificial Intelligence algorithms compute optimal paths in a grid-based environment.

It allows users to simulate real-world navigation scenarios and observe how different algorithms explore and find paths between two points.

The project is built as part of a Bring Your Own Project (BYOP) to apply AI/ML fundamentals in a practical, visual, and intuitive way.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

In real-world environments such as urban navigation (e.g., road networks in cities), finding the shortest or most efficient route is a critical challenge.

Most users rely on applications like GPS systems without understanding how these decisions are made.
This project addresses the problem:

How can we simulate and visualize intelligent pathfinding to better understand decision-making in AI systems?

FEATURES AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS :

Functional Features:

 Interactive grid-based environment

 User-defined:

o Start node

o End node

o Obstacles (walls)

 Visualization of algorithms in real time

 Multiple algorithm support:

o Breadth-First Search (BFS)

o Depth-First Search (DFS)

o A* (A-Star) Algorithm

 Path reconstruction after goal is reached

Controls :

 Mouse Click → Place start, end, and barriers

 1 → BFS

 2 → DFS

 3 → A*

 SPACE → Run algorithm

 C → Clear grid

TECHNOLOGY STACK AND ARCHITECTURE :

 Language: Python

 Library: Pygame

 Concepts: AI Search Algorithms, Heuristics

Architecture :

 Grid-based system (2D matrix)

 Each cell represented as a node (Spot class)

 Algorithms operate on graph abstraction:

o Nodes → grid cells

o Edges → adjacent cells

Flow :

1. User creates environment

2. Grid is converted into graph

3. Selected algorithm runs

4. Visualization updates in real time

TESTING APPROACH :

Functional Testing:

 Verified pathfinding for all algorithms

 Checked correct handling of:

o Obstacles

o Start/End placement

 Tested edge cases:

o No possible path

o Start = End

Algorithm Validation:

 BFS → Always finds shortest path

 DFS → May not find optimal path

 A* → Efficient and optimal

User Interaction Testing:

 Mouse clicks

 Keyboard inputs

 Grid reset functionality

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS :

 Performance: Real-time visualization with smooth updates

 Usability: Simple controls and intuitive interface

 Scalability: Grid size can be modified

 Maintainability: Modular and readable code structure

 Reliability: Handles invalid inputs gracefully

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :

 Add Dijkstra’s Algorithm

 Introduce weighted nodes (traffic simulation)

 GUI buttons instead of keyboard controls

 Real-world map integration

 Performance metrics (time taken, nodes explored)

 3D visualization

LEARNING OUTCOMES :

 Understanding of search algorithms

 Importance of heuristics in AI

 Differences between informed and uninformed search

 Practical implementation of theoretical concepts
